### Cosmetics labeling authorities
In the United States, cosmetics labeling is regulated by the FDA. The authority
to regulate cosmetics was granted by Congress in 1938 through the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Under the act, the FDA does not approve cosmetics, like 
it does for drugs, but only regulates cosmetics. The differences between drugs 
and cosmetics are defined in the legislation.

In 1966, the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act gave the FDA authority to regulate 
cosmetic labeling, and in 1974, the FDA added labeling requirements for 
cosmetics to Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations. What was going on in 
the 8 years between? They were working on it, I guess.

It is difficult to piece together everything that was going on over 50 years ago,
but it seems that everyone thought that a cosmetic labeling requirement was a 
big deal. After going so long without having to label what was inside their 
products, asking companies to list all of the ingredients appeared to be a win 
for consumers.

There is not much historical information available about what was going on 
behind the scenes, but a new player emerged in the regulatory code---the 
Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association, Inc. (CTFA). The CTFA's Cosmetic 
Ingredient Dictionary is listed as the 
[primary source](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/part-701/section-701.3#p-701.3(c)(2)) 
for ingredient names.

The CTFA, now called the Personal Care Products Council (PCPC), is a trade 
association representing cosmetics and personal care products companies. It is 
founded and funded by cosmetics companies with dozens of big brand executives on 
its board of directors. As a nonprofit organization, it is required to report 
financial information, and in 2023, it made 
[$22.4 million in revenue](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/131390920) 
and paid its CEO $1.4 million.

Basically, the PCPC lobbied themselves into being responsible for the dictionary 
of cosmetic ingredients that the FDA requires cosmetics companies to use for 
product labels.

## Introduction
### Project goals
The goal of this project is to obtain a global view of what skincare companies 
are putting in their facial moisturizers. Most large manufacturers of cosmetics 
have a moisturizer on the market. You can go through the ingredient lists one 
by one, but with dozens of ingredients in each list, keeping track of what is 
in each moisturizer is incredibly difficult. What if we could look at all of 
the ingredient lists at once? We might be better able to tease out similarities 
and differences. We might be able to see which ingredients are important and 
which ones are just fluff. We might also be able to achieve the holy grail of 
skincare -- finding dupes for expensive products so that we don't waste our 
money.

_Disclaimer:_ I am a scientist who is not happy with the state of the skincare 
industry. I am pretty sure that skincare companies are just making stuff up and 
always have been. They are not doing much research (outside of marketing and 
maybe safety testing). They are more interested in combining different goops 
and gunks than actually inventing anything new. Their main focus is getting 
people to buy their products. So they put all of their effort and money into 
marketing and copying the things that other people have successfully marketed.

### Cosmetics labeling regulations

:::

In the United States, cosmetics labeling is regulated by the FDA. The authority
to regulate cosmetics was granted by Congress in 1938 through the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Under the act, the FDA only approves cosmetics. It does
not regulate them, like it does for drugs. The differences between drugs and 
cosmetics are defined in the legislation.

In 1966, the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act gave the FDA authority to regulate 
cosmetic labeling, and in 1974, the FDA added labeling requirements for 
cosmetics to Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations in section 701.3. The 
guidelines for labeling are simple---maybe a little too simple. In 1974, it was 
a big deal to just have ingredient names on the products, but the for this 
project, it would be nice if the rules were stricter and more detailed.

### Ingredient list rules
The regulations begin by stating that the name of each ingredient should be 
listed in descending order of predominance. However, an alternative scheme for 
grouping ingredients is provided and is the main method used by modern 
cosmetics companies.

Ingredients may be grouped and the groups listed in the following manner and 
order:

 * Ingredients, other than color additives, present at a concentration greater 
 than 1 percent, in descending order of predominance; followed by
 
 * Ingredients, other than color additives, present at a concentration of not 
 more than 1 percent, without respect to order of predominance; followed by
 
 * Color additives, without respect to order of predominance.
 
This means that ingredients at less than 1% concentration do not have to be 
listed in any order. In practice, this allows companies to move trendy 
ingredients up in the list and synthetic-sounding chemical names lower in the 
list. 

The regulatory code also says that companies should prioritize the use of names 
from the Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary, which is written by the Cosmetic, 
Toiletry and Fragrance Association. This trade association has changed their 
name to the Personal Care Products Council (PCPC) and now publishes their 
database of ingredient names online. They developed the International 
Nomenclature Cosmetic Ingredient (INCI) system for their ingredient dictionary 
in 1973, in preparation for the FDA labeling requirements. The INCI system 
standardizes ingredient names, but as we will see, cosmetics companies still 
love to add their own twists.

### Moisturizer basics
Everyone knows that a moisturizer is supposed to moisturize your skin, but what 
are the ingredients actually doing?

There are four main components that are usually included in moisturizers:

 1. Water---Duh. This is the main moisturizing ingredient. So why not just 
 splash water on your face? Moisturizers contain other ingredients to both hold 
 onto water and trap it in your skin.
 
 1. Occlusives---Oil-based molecules that provide a barrier to stop the water 
 from evaporating too quickly.
 
 1. Humectants---Molecules that like water and will hold onto it to keep it on 
 the skin.
 
 1. Emollients---Molecules that fill in cracks in the skin to make it feel 
 smoother.

## Getting the data

OK, enough background, let's get our hands on some data. I got the best-seller 
results from [Target](https://www.target.com/) and 
[Sephora](https://www.sephora.com/), and created a 
[google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS4wAroj1XvB4aiuOg97IdS6xNd2x0wsylwXOYZZlCAysx3n5SA9Fi3IcLrbWGe_e7cuhzW2_fOl8qj/pubhtml) 
with each product's brand name, product name, price, size, and product link on 
[INCIDecoder](https://www.incidecoder.com), which is where we will be scraping 
the ingredient lists. Sadly, the Target and Sephora websites are difficult to 
scrape. I had to gather all of the data by hand :( I might try to implement 
that in the future with [RSelenium](https://docs.ropensci.org/RSelenium/). 

The google sheet is imported using the 
[googlesheets4 R package](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/).
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false

# productSheet <- read_sheet("1LVIoYIZDoDtc26z5JMHpv_7a34aqSZwdFsazG8_JlfY")
# write.csv(productSheet, paste0(here(), "/data/productSheet.csv"), row.names = F)

productSheet <- read.csv("./data/productSheet.csv")
```

Here are the top few entries:
```{r}
#| echo: false

kable(head(productSheet, n = 5L))
```

Next, we loop through all of the INCIDecoder product URLs and grab the 
ingredient lists using the [rvest package](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/).
```{r}
#| echo: false

# source("./functions/createIngredientLists.R")
# ingredientLists <- createIngredientLists(productSheet)

ingredientLists <- readRDS("./data/ingredientLists")
```

Here are the the first 5 ingredients from the first 3 products:
```{r}
#| echo: false

kable(sapply(ingredientLists[1:3], head, 5))
```

As you might notice. We have some problems with how ingredients are labeled. 
The main ingredient in each of those products is water. Of course, these 
companies can't just call it water. They have to be special and call it "Aqua," 
or "Eau," or "Purified." And don't get me started on "La Roche-Posay Prebiotic 
Thermal Water."

## Water is water, right?

How many names for water can there be?
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 7

ingredientsAll <- as.vector(do.call(c, ingredientLists, quote=T))
waterNames <- ingredientsAll[grep("Water|Aqua|Eau", ingredientsAll)]
waterNames <- gsub("[^ -~]+", "", waterNames)
waterNames <- waterNames[-grep("Citrullus|Rosa|Vitis", waterNames)]
waterCounts <- sort(table(waterNames), decreasing = TRUE)
waterDf <- data.frame(waterCounts)
## move La Roche-Posay water to the end
waterDf <- waterDf[c(1:10, 12:13, 11),]
waterDf$waterNames <- factor(waterDf$waterNames, levels = waterDf$waterNames)

ggplot(waterDf, aes(waterNames, Freq)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label = Freq), nudge_y = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Different Names for Water",
       x = "",
       y = "Counts") +
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 30)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, hjust = 0.5),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank())
```

We will need to do a lot of data cleaning in order to analyze any of these 
ingredient lists. I will spare you most of the details. Briefly, I converted 
all of the ingredient names to lowercase, removed unnecessary characters, and 
merged many ingredients by hand (really I just used a bunch of regular 
expressions.)

Let's count how many unique ingredients we have after each cleaning step.

## Cleaning up

```{r}
#| echo: false

## load countUniqueIngredients function and ingredient regex data
source("./functions/countUniqueIngredients.R")
source("./data/ingredientRegex.R")

countUniqueIngredients(ingredientLists = ingredientLists, 
                       title = "# of original ingredients")

ingredientListsUpperCase <- lapply(ingredientLists, toupper)
countUniqueIngredients(ingredientLists = ingredientListsUpperCase, 
                       title = "# of uppercase ingredients")

ingredientListsNoWeirdness <- lapply(ingredientListsUpperCase, 
                                     str_replace_all, 
                                     strangeCharactersRegex)
countUniqueIngredients(ingredientLists = ingredientListsNoWeirdness, 
                       title = "# of ingredients w/o strange characters")

names(ingredientRegex) <- toupper(names(ingredientRegex))
ingredientRegex <- toupper(ingredientRegex)
ingredientListsClean <- lapply(ingredientListsNoWeirdness, 
                               str_replace_all, 
                               ingredientRegex)
countUniqueIngredients(ingredientLists = ingredientListsClean, 
                       title = "# of merged and cleaned ingredients")

## save cleaned ingredient lists
saveRDS(ingredientListsClean, "./data/ingredientListsClean")
```

Now that we have cleaned our ingredient names and gone from 857 to 713 unique 
ingredients, we can do some actual analysis of the data.
